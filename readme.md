# GenAI Cohort üöÄ

A collection of modular projects and experiments exploring Generative AI concepts and applications. This repository is structured to guide you through key GenAI workflows step by step ‚Äî from basic tokenization to advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LangGraph flows, and human-in-the-loop systems.
